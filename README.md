# MSU Manager Service
This components manages various aspects for Mobilytix Sensoring Units among which are power and thermal management.\
One of its core features is receiving commands from the HCU (Hardware Control Unit).

## Local Development
To run the application manually you can use Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
poetry run fastapi run msu_manager/main.py
```

## Usage

Service is shipped as APT package, see [release](https://github.com/starwit/msu-manager/releases) page to download latest package. How to configure and use service see [manual](doc/MANUAL.md).

## Build

Here are all necessarey information for developers, to build and run service.

### Prerequisites
Things you need to build package.

* Python 
* Poetry
* build-essentials

### Build APT package
Makefile has target to build an APT package. Virtual environment is created by exporting Poetry dependencies into a requirements.txt file. APT is build like so:
```bash
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
make build-deb
```

APT package can then be found in folder _target_. You can test installation using Docker, however SystemD (probably) won't work.
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ./target:/app  jrei/systemd-ubuntu:latest bash
apt update && apt install -y /app/msu-manager_0.0.7_all.deb
```
You can however test, if everything is installed to the right place. If you want to test service use the following examples:
```bash
echo -n '{"command": "HEARTBEAT","version" : "0.0.3"}' | nc -4u -q1 localhost 5151
echo -n '{"command": "LOG", "key": "temperature", "value": "42.0"}' | nc -4u -q1 localhost 5151
echo -n '{"command": "SHUTDOWN"}' | nc -4u -q1 localhost 5151
echo -n '{"command": "RESUME"}' | nc -4u -q1 localhost 5151
```
